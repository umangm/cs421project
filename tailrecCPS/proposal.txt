Title: Checking Tail Recursion using CPS transformation in PicoML

We intend to check if a program defined in PicoML, having the form
    let rec f x k = RHS_expression      -- (1)
is tail recursive or not.

Given an expression e and identifier f, e is said to be "tail-recursive in f",

1. e = ConstCPS (k', c) and k' is cont_tail recursive in f

2. e = VarCPS (k', v), and k' is cont_tail recursive in f

3. e = MonOpAppCPS (k', m, o1, exk) and k' is cont_tail recursive in f

4. e = BinOpAppCPS (k', b, o1, o2, exk) and k' is cont_tail recursive in f

5. e = IfCPS(b, e1, e2), and
    a. e1 is tail recursive in f, and
    b. e2 is tail recursive in f

6. e = AppCPS(k', e1, e2, exk)
    a. If e1 = f and k' != k then false
    b. If e1 = f and k' = k then true
    c. else k' is cont_tail recursive in f

7. e = FunCPS (k', x, i1, i2, e)
    a. true

8. e = FixCPS (k', , , , , e)
    a. true

cont_tail_recursive k f:

1. k = ContVarCPS i, then true
2. k = External, then true 
3. k = FnContCPS(x, e), then
    a. if x= f , then true
    b. if x!=f then e is tail recursive in f
4. k = ExnMatch - NO IDEA
   

* A program defined as (1) is "tail-recursive" if RHS_expresison is "tail-recursive in f"
