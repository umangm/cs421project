Each line in the file \texttt{testing.txt} is a test case. 
To see testing results, run \texttt{./tailRecPicoMLTest} after doing a  \texttt{make}

Test cases can be categorized as follows:

\subsection{Smoke Tests}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, caption=Smoke Tests]
5;; (* for dec = (Anon e) *)
let f = 5;; (* for dec = Let (s, e) *)
let rec f x = 100;; (* smoke test for ConstExp *)
let rec f x = x;; (* smoke test for VarExp *)
let rec f x = hd x;; (* smoke test for MonOp *)
let rec f x = x + x;; (* smoke test for BinOp *)
let rec f x = f 5;; (* smoke test for AppExp *)
let rec f x = (fun x -> x);; (* smoke test for FunExp *)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Typical Example Cases}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, caption=Typical Example Cases]
let rec f x = if (x=0) then 0 else f (x-1);; (* typical tail-recursive example *)
let rec f x = if (x=0) then 0 else x * (f (x-1));; (* typical not tail-recursive example *)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{More Test Cases}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, caption=More Test Cases]
let rec f x = if (x=0) then 0 else f(f(f(f (x-1))));; (* a variavation of typical tail-recursive example *)
let rec f x = let f = 5 in f + f;; (* for LetIn: redefine f *)
let rec f x = if (x=0) then 0+0+0+0 else (f (x-1));; (* for BinOp *)
let rec f x = (fun y -> 0) x;; (* more cases for FunExp and AppExp *)
let rec f x = (fun x -> x * x) x ;;
let rec f x = (fun x -> x * (f x)) x ;;
let rec f x = let x_0=(x=0) in if x_0 then 0 else (f (x-1));; (* more cases for LetIn *)
let rec f x = let f_x_1=(f (x-1)) in if x = 0 then 0 else f_x_1;;
let rec f x = let g = (f (x-1)) in if (x=0) then 0 else g;;
let rec f x = let g = x-1 in if (x=0) then 0 else f g;;
let rec f x = let g = (f x) + (f x) in if (x=0) then 0 else (f (x-1));;
let rec f x = let g = (f x) + (f x) in if (x=0) then 0 else g;;
let rec f x = let rec g y = y * y in if (x=0) then (g 0) else (f (x-1));; (* more cases for LetRecIn *)
let rec f x = let rec f y = 0 in if (x=0) then (f 0) else (f (x-1));;
let rec f x = let rec g f = 0 in if (x=0) then (g 0) else (f (x-1));;
let rec f x = let rec g y = (f y) in if (x=0) then 0 else (f (x-1));;
let rec f x = let rec g y = (f y) + (f y) in if (x=0) then 0 else g x;;
let rec f x = let rec g y = (f y) in if (x=0) then 0 else (g (x-1));;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Test Cases that aren't handled well}

The following test cases, are known to be either failing, or pass without the correct reason (that is, they do not fit out characterization for the correct reason)
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, caption=Unhandled Test Cases]
let rec f x = let f = f in if (x=0) then 0 else (f (x-1));; (* more cases for LetIn: aliases *)
let rec f x = let g = f in if (x=0) then 0 else g (x-1);;
let rec f x = let g = f in g x;;
let rec f x = let g = f in if (x=0) then 0 else (g (x-1));;
let rec f x = let g = f in if (x=0) then 0 else (x-1)*(g (x-1));; (* Failed with both styles since we can't handle aliases well *)
let rec f x = let g = f in let h = g in if (x=0) then 0 else (h (x-1))*(x-1);; (* Failed with both styles since we can't handle aliases well *)
\end{lstlisting}
